      <h1>Polycube unfolding</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to work with different methods to unfold
        polycubes. The polycube is a 3-dimensional geometrical figure created
        with cubes next to each other. The unfolding that we worked on consist
        of dividing the 3D figure on its edges (and faces in polycube tree) into
        2D faces to flatten the figure to 2-dimensions. We worked with 2
        different unfolding methods, each working for a specific shape of
        polycubes. The question if any polycube can be unfolded by cutting the
        edges is still an open question [O’R19], this is why we focused only on
        unfolding Convexe polycube [DM24] and Polycube trees [DF21].

      <h3>Convex polycube unfolding (Mathieu Van Den Bremt)</h3>
      <p1>
        Edge-Unfolding Polycubes with Orthogonally Convex Layers. The paper
        [DM24] describes a 4 step algorithm to unfold any polycube if it has
        orthogonally convex layers. The verification of the convexity of the
        layers is done in a following section.<br />
        <br />
        The main idea is to use the concepts of bridges, bands and clockwise or
        counter clockwise pointers. But in order to do that we first had to find
        all the parts of the algorithm. <br /><br />
        <h4>Finding the structure</h4>
        We first had to find every part of the structure. The structure is first
        divided by layers, every layer has a bridge that connects to the next
        layer, a R (called Ri for the ith layer), a L (called Li for the ith
        layer) and a i band (connection between the Ri and Li for the ith
        layer). R and L are the leftmost and rightmost cell of a band, but have
        to be found before the band (see how to find them in paper [DM24])
        <br />
        Thus in the first part of the program we travel through the layers of
        the polycube that have been previously found. This part follows the
        rules from the paper [DM24] to find every Ri, Li and bridge. The bands
        can be found later because they are the only set of faces between Ri and
        Li. The pointers are also found in this part because they depend on the
        normals of Ri and Li+1. <br />
        It was not easy to accomplish because the paper [DM24] tend to take some
        parts of the structure as evident which of course are much more
        difficult to find in code. The first part of our program's complexity
        varies a lot depending of cases, in general, most faces can only be
        verified once to see in what part of the structure they are. However
        quite often the verification could visite a great number of the other
        faces. Thus we estimate the complexity as <b>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</b> where
        n is the number of faces. In the paper [DM24] it is unclear what
        complexity they would need because they seem to just "know" every part
        of the structure. <br /><br />
        <h4>The unfolding itself</h4>
        This is where the unfolding is done. With all of the structure found, it
        is now possible to do the unfolding. The unfolding can be explains as :
        <ul>
          <li>Unfold bands and bridges</li>
          <li>Unfold top layer and lateral faces not part of a band</li>
          <li>Unfold bottom faces</li>
          <li>Unfold remaining edge cases</li>
        </ul>
        Once again, it is easier said than done to code. Our program thus
        followed as much as possible the 4 steps in order, but some parts of
        certain steps where mixed to make it easier to code. The final results
        of the unfolding looks very similar to what it should be. The minor
        changes do not affect the good unfolding of the polycube. To prove it we
        tested on a reproduction of the polycube the paper [DM24] uses as an
        example. The unfolding looks very similar. <br />
        The complexity of the second part should be of <b>O(n)</b> with
        <i>n</i> the number of outside faces. But looking at it with a more
        programming aspect, we estimated closer to <b>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</b> once
        again. <br /><br />
        <h4>Results</h4>
        In the end, the algorithm does work and we estimate a total complexity
        of this unfolding to <b>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</b>
      </p1>
      <h3>Convexity of a polycube (Mathieu Van Herp)</h3>
      <p1>
        A layer is convex if two rules are met: that all the cubes contained in
        that layer are connected and that any two cubes sharing a coordinate
        (that isn't the layer coordinate) must have cubes in all position
        between them. The first rule ensure that no two island of cubes can
        exist by insuring stair shaped paths and the second one ensure that no
        holes are allowed inside the layer.<br /><br />
        To check the first rule, we first do a breadth first search to check
        that the entire polycube is connexted, then we need 3 dictionary, one
        for each axis plane. Where the key is the value of the given axis and
        the value contain 4 variable used to store the min and max value found
        for the other axis and two list containing respectively the first and
        second coordinates of the cube's adjacency in that plane with no
        repetitions. <br />
        The cube's adjacency is represented by the coordinate of the cube +/-
        0.5 in the direction of the adjacent cube. <br />
        For example if two cubes exists on the same plane X = 2 and that they
        both share the same Z coordinates the dictionary would contain {2 :
        [cube1.y - 0.5, cube2.y + 0.5],[cube.z + 0.5] } if cube 1 had a cube
        adjacent to it's bottom face, that cube2 had a cube adjacent to it's top
        face and that both of them had a cube adjacent to their front faces.<br />
        Theses will allow us to check if a plane contains a stair shape path
        between the left most cube and right most cube and between the highest
        cube and the lowest cube of the plane. Those stairs shapes could have
        holes left in them but those will be taken care of in the second rule.
        <br /><br />
        For the second rule we need 3 dictionary too, they will contain each
        orthogonal beam of cubes that exist. As such the keys will be the
        combination of the two invariant coordinates and the values will be the
        axis values on which we are checking the convexity. <br />
        For example on the two cubes y = 5, z = 4 with different x coordinates,
        we have the dictionary {"yz" : [cube1.x, cube2.x]}. <br /><br />
        Having structured the dictionary has such, we only have to check for
        each key of each dictionary if the following equality holds for each
        value list (two in the cases of the planes) : MaxValue - MinValue =
        list.length. <br />
        If the equality holds it mean that there exist a cube in every space
        between the two cubes in a planar manner (diagonal included) or in a
        line manner depending of the dictionary.<br />
        If it doesn't hold we need to flag the corresponding axis as not convex.
        The corresponding is either the key axis in the plane dictionnary or the
        value axis in the beam dictionary.<br />
        Once we know which axis are convex or not we can choose the either the
        remaining one or the smallest of the valid ones so that we avoid
        unnecessary computation.<br />
        This structure induces that in the worst case scenario we stay in linear
        time, having to build 3 dictionaries of size n, 3 dictionaries of size
        2n + 2, and having to check 6n keys with 3n keys having to check the
        equality for the 2 list giving us a complexity of <b>O(n)</b>.

        Unfolding polycube tree with constant refinement [DF21] (Marek
        Chmielewski)
      </h3>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        In this section, we present the second article that we analyzed. It was
        about unfolding polycube trees with constant refinement.<br />
        First let us define a few key concepts:
      </p>
      <p>
        A polycube tree is a specialized polycube that has a dual which is a
        tree. In other words, we can represent each cube as a vertex and add
        edges for any 2 adjacent cubes, adjacent means that they share a face
        between them.
        <br />
        The graph created by such construction must be a tree.<br />
        Trivialy checked by using a breadth first search, checking that no two
        cube can appear twice in the execution and that all cubes are considered
        implying no islands (Mathieu Van Herp).
      </p>
      <p>
        The most general unfoldings unfold only along edges as in the first
        article [DM24]. In this case however, we unfold on edges and
        occasionally also on faces of a cube. <br />
        A refinement means that any face can be further divided into a
        <i>[a * b]</i>
        orthogonal grid for <i> a </i> and <i> b </i> being integers bigger than
        1. This refinement is sometimes necessary to ensure that no faces
        overlap in the final unfolding. Refinement is also used to connect 2
        non-adjacent cubes by dividing the face of the cube that is between
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this article [DF21], we talk about constant refinement. We do so
        because the first results in this domain required an exponential
        refinement among the grid space [DFO06]. Each new algorithm tried to
        reduce the maximum refinement until reaching a linear refinement [CY15].
        <br />
        Algorithms requiring a sublinear refinement exist only for specialized
        orthogonal classes, such as polycubes. This article [DF21], shows the
        first constant refinement algorithm for polycube trees.
      </p>
      <h4>Algorithm</h4>
      <p>
        The way that a polycube is unfolded is by recursion. It creates an
        unfolding path across faces to know the order in which they will be
        unfolded (in our code, the unfolding path is simply a list with faces
        that will be seen during the execution). <br />
        First we can select any cube of the polycube of degree 1 and design it
        as the root, it will be the cube that will start and end the unfolding.
      </p>
      <p>
        The algorithm will recursively traverse the neighbors of the cube that
        we currently process. In the first step it will examine the only
        neighbor of the root. <br />
        Then the next step is to unfold the next cube. Every cube may have a
        different unfolding depending on the degree of such cube. <br />
        Except for cubes of degree 1 (cubes that are leaves in the dual graph)
        and cubes of degree 6 (cubes that have neighbors in every direction),
        all other cubes have a specific unfolding depending on the orientation
        of their neighbors
      </p>
      <p>
        This part of the algorithm is the most complicated because for each
        degree between 2 and 5, the algorithm examines the direction of its
        neighbors. We always assume that it entered the current cube by its
        front face, it will then look at the opposite face (back face) and the
        faces at the north, south, east and west. <br />
        Based on the degree of the current cube and on the direction of his
        neighbors, the algorithm can take a specific unfolding path, store the
        faces of the current cube in the order in which they will be unfolded
        and when the path enters an adjacent cube, do the recursive unfolding on
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proof that the unfolding path works is proved in the article [DF21].
        It uses 3 unfolding invariants to prove that those specific path will
        hold and give a valid unfolding. All cubes besides the root must satisfy
        these invariants to ensure that the unfolding is indeed possible and
        correct.
      </p>
      <h4>Main results</h4>
      <p>
        The main objectif of this article is to prove the following theorem:
        <br />
        <i>Every polycube tree can be unfolded with a constant refinement.</i>
        <br />
        This theorem was proved alongside the construction of the unfolding
        path. The proof consist of checking invariants 1-3 for every possible
        combination of neighbors. Ultimately, every possible combination was
        proved to have a correct unfolding so the proof was complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our implementation, the unfolding also works recursively and we check
        every cube only once so the complexity of the unfolding is
        <b>O(n)</b> with <i> n </i> being the number of cubes in the polycube.
        <br />
        For the plotting part we used a dictionary to keep in track how many
        times a face occured in the list. The construction of this dictionary
        costs
        <b>O(m)</b> with <i>m</i> being the number of faces in the face list.
        Then, when the dictionary exists and contains a value for every face we
        can iterate the elements of the face list and plot the corresponding
        face according to its position. This also takes <b>O(m)</b>, so the
        total time complexity of plotting is of <b>O(2m)</b>, which is still
        linear.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <i> m > n </i> so the overall complexity of the whole code is
        <b> O(2m) </b>.
      </p>
